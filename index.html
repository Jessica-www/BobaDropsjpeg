    <h1>Boba Drops</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Boba drops!<p>Bubble tea is most commonly made with tapioca pearls (also known as "boba"), but it can be made with other toppings as well, such as grass jelly, aloe vera, red bean, and popping boba. It has many varieties and flavours, but the two most popular varieties are pearl black milk tea and pearl green milk tea ("pearl" for the tapioca balls at the bottom).</p>
